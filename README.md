# countries-application
React Single Page Web Application that interacts with the REST Countries API
## Background
This is my first React project, I have some experience with Javascript, HTML and CSS
## Approach
- I'll be using ChatGPT and other online resources to work on the application and learn React
- I'm time boxing it to spend a maxmimum of 6 hours
- I'll see how far I get and if necessary after about 5.5 hours write a **Further Work** section
- Priorities are learning and functionality. Quality and polish will come later if time allows
- I will ask ChatGPT for help with specific tasks like ¨create a button¨, "add specific behaviour to button" as opposed to feeding it the assignment, getting it to create a solution and then spending hours trying to fix it
## Plan
1. Environment set up
2. Add ag-grid control that does nothing
3. Populate grid from API
4. Add country detail details control that does nothing
5. Populate country details when country clicked
6. Add search functionality
7. Add favourites functionality
